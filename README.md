Industrial Procedure Ontology
===================
The Industrial Procedure Ontology is published [https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/khub-procedure](https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/khub-procedure).

### Purpose and scope of the vocabulary
The Industrial Procedure Ontology was developed to support the retrieval of information from procedures described in documents such as service manuals, user manuals etc... used in the manufacturing field. The Ontology models the procedures (also called Plan) for performing maintenance on manufacturing products or services. The Procedure is decomposed in Steps which needs to be followed in the right order. Sometimes a Step is represented by an entire procedure as well.
